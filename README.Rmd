`isaacr` is an R package with an assortment of R functions that are useful to me. It's just a collection of functions that I've written over the years, and storing them in a package is a convenient way to keep them organized and accessible.

## Installation

You can install the development version of isaacr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("isaacbain/isaacr")
```

## Documentation

The main documentation for `isaacr` can be found at [isaacbain.com/isaacr](https://isaacbain.com/isaacr/).
